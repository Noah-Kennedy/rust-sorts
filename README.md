# Rust Sorts
## What is this?
The Rust standard library has some pretty good sorts built in, and they are fine for most cases.
However, there are some cases that call for more specialized sorting algorithms.
That is what this library is for.

## Status
Currently, there are some burstsort implementations (why I made this) in here, but not much else.
I'd like to get burstsort onto crates.io fairly soon.
